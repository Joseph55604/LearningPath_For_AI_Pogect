# LearningPath_For_AI_Pogect
I am currently studying for a project that i want to make as a self acomplishment that i hope will help the enviorment in some sort of way.
As I am hardly studying every day i created this repository to get people to know me as a computer scientist in formation(currently in High School), I am also a hispanic so I am sorry if i misspell anything english is my current second lenguaje.
What I also want from posting this repository would be for people to recommend me stuff, for people to correct me on everything i might have done wrong, and maybe at some point to create bonds with other programers that might be able to help me in my project, i would really apreciate if you took the time to look into a project of a random highschooler in internet.
